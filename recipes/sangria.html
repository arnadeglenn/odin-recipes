    <h2 class="heading1">Description</h2>
     <p class="text">
        After creating a dinner with the <a href=./pasta.html>handmade pasta</a> and <a href=./bolognese.html>bolognese</a>, we will now make a drink pairing to complete the dinner. Sangria is a mixed drink that is composed of fruits and your favorite wine. This drink tends to be on the sweeter side and it is fantastic to pair with the pasta dish we made. Feel free to sip the night away!
